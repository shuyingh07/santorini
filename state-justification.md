# Justification for handling state
Below, describe where you stored each of the following states and justify your answers with design principles/goals/heuristics/patterns. Discuss the alternatives and trade-offs you considered during your design process.

## Players
`Players` is stored in the `Game` class. In `Game` class, we will have a `playerList`, which stores the `player` object of each player.

- Justification:
    - High Cohesion: `playerList` allows the `Game` class to track all players involved in the game. This is crucial for managing player turns and other player-related game logic.
    - Easy to Extend: If the game rules allow for more players to join, or if there are variations in the number of players, `playerList` can be easily modified to accommodate these changes.

- Alternatives & Trade-offs:
    - we can creating a `PlayerManager` class to manage players. This can help further decouple game logic from player management. However, I think the main task of the `Game` class is to handle the rotation between players and set the winner. Introducing a new `PlayerManager` class will increase the overall complexity of the system. We will need to understand and maintain more classes and their interactions.


## Current player
`Current player` is stored in the `Game` class, and is identified by by an `player` object.

- Justification:  
    - High Cohesion for `Game` class: The `Game` class is responsible for controlling the game flow, and the `currentPlayer` is a key component of the game flow. Placing the currentState in the `Gam`e class allows the `Game` class to focus more on its responsibility, which is managing the game process.
    - Low Coupling: The logic related to player rotation is encapsulated within the `Game` class. Other classes do not need to know the detailed information about player rotation; they only need to interact with the public interface of the `Game` class. For example, the `Player` class does not need to directly manage or query who the current player is, reducing direct interaction between classes.

- Alternatives & Trade-offs:
    - We can set a boolean value `isCurrentPlayer` in the `Player` class to indicate whether it is the current player. However, with this design, every time when Game wants to get the current player, it needs to interact with the `Player` class. Also,`isCurrentPlayer` value in each player objects needs to be modified everytime we change the player, making the code complex and not achieving low coupling.

## Worker locations
`Worker locations` is stored in the `Worker` class, I use two integer variables `x` and `y` to represent the current location.

- Justification: 
    - Encapsulation: Placing the location information of a Worker within its own class helps to encapsulate the data and behavior related to the Worker together. This ensures the privacy and integrity of the object's state, allowing modifications to its location information only through methods of the Worker class.
    - Information Expertï¼šWorker is the information expert regarding its own location, so it should be responsible for handling the logic related to its position, such as movement.
- Alternatives & Trade-offs:
    - A alternative method is to track the positions of all his workers in the `Player` class. This may help the `Player` class better coordinate the actions of its workers. However, it may make the `Player` class overly large and complex, handling logic that does not belong to it, thus reducing its clarity and cohesion.

## Towers
The `tower` state is recorded in the `Grid` class, using the `height` parameter in each grid to represent the tower's height. If `height=1`, it means that no tower has been built on that grid. If `height=4`, it indicates that the tower has already added a `dome` and cannot be increased in height further.

- Justification: 
    - High Cohesion: By managing the tower height within the `Grid` class, we can maintain high cohesion within the class. This class encompasses all operations and information related to grid cells, making it easy to maintain and understand.
- Alternatives & Trade-offs:
    - It is possible to create a separate Tower class specifically to manage the tower's state.
    - The trade-off is that this would increase the complexity of the system and could potentially lead to interface dependencies between Tower and Grid. Additionally, having a Tower object instance for each grid cell might increase memory usage.

## Winner
`Winner` is stored in the `Game` class, and is identified by an `player` object.
- Justification:  
    - High Cohesion for `Game` class: Managing the `Winner` in the `Game` class helps maintain high cohesion, as all relevant game state and control flow are centralized within a single logical unit.
    - Information Expert: The `Game` class is an information expert in managing the game state, so it should know who the `Winner` is. This is because the `Game` class itself is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the game's winning conditions

- Alternatives & Trade-offs:
    - We can set a boolean value `isWinner` in the `Player` class to indicate whether it is the winner. The disadvantage of doing this is that it may violate the principle of encapsulation because now the winning logic is scattered across each `Player` object, and we need to check all players to determine the winner.
